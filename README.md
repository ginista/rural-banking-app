In todayâ€™s digital world, large scale banking industries have the luxury to build and use various software applications to meet their business needs like handling customer information, storing transaction details, providing online services and so on. But a large number of small scale fintech industries are still using manual methods like writing in a notebook to handle customer data and their transactions. They can't afford to build their own software application. In order to solve this problem, the idea is to build a website, make it available online so that any organization can subscribe and make use of it

The project is a SaaS web application developed using Spring Boot and JSP, deployed in Azure Web App and secured with Azure Active Directory. The fintech companies can register with a subscription plan based on their requirements. The prototype web application is subscribed by a test fintech company named AG Infotech. AG Infotech can perform the below business functionalities: 1) Add Customer -> Used to add new customer entry (On successful creation customer id will be displayed) 2) Search Customer -> Use the customer id/email id/mobile number to search customer data. In the search view, the customer details, loan account details and loan transactions will be displayed. You will find the below 4 buttons in the search view i) Modify Customer Details -> Used to update the mobile number/email id/Address of the customer ii) Pay -> Used to make full/partial payment of the existing loan(On full payment, status will be updated to Inactive(I)) iii) View Transactions -> Used to view the transaction records of that particular loan account iv) Add New Loan -> Can be used to create new loan account for the customer 3) Logout -> Used to invalidate existing session. Please find the Azure Active Directory test employee login credential for the AG Infotech below: Username: test-user@ruralbanking.onmicrosoft.com Password: testuser@249 Test Customer Id: 1 can be used to search existing test data
